NOTE: We do not recommend *actually* running outdated software.

Bluffingo's Updater isn't really a proper tool to keep your applications up-to-date. This is more intended for setups pretending to be setups from the late-2000s/early-2010s. This is why there's a "time machine" feature and why it's based on .NET Framework 3.5.

It works with an (incomplete) website that has a database of software releases complete with the release dates.
